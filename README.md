# COMP4900

The plan is to create an autonomous bot that can pick up and deliver packages in a timely manner in either a warehouse or an urban city setting with dynamic environments (including city street rules, traffic signals - in case we do the urban city setting or pedestrians and normal humans in warehouses)

The goal is to use a grid graph representation to make it easier

Proposed RL techniques: 
1. Temporal Difference Q-Learning
2. Deep Q-Learning
3. Proximal Policy Optimization: https://towardsdatascience.com/proximal-policy-optimization-ppo-explained-abed1952457b
4. Actor Critic Methods (A2C): https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-actor-critic-methods-931b97b6df3f
